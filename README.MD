## Software dependencies
You may need to install additional packages to proceed the tutorial.
- Jupyter: `pip install jupyter`        for development environment
- Numpy: `pip install numpy`            for numerical calculation 
- Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`  for data visualization
- scipy: `pip install scipy`            for statistical computation
- h5py: `pip install h5py`              for HDF data read/write

You can download and install `ActflowToolbox` by run below command and it's recommended for end-users. but in this course tutorial, I won't use `ActflowToolbox` but I will proceed the tutorial by using basic scientific computing packages only.
- ActflowToolbox: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ColeLab/ActflowToolbox.git`
